===============================

Arcade game with player-hero needing to cross over path full of enemies-bugs to
reach the water at the end.

To start the game just open arcade-game/index.html with browser File - Open
option.

Before starting, you can set the difficulty level between 1 (easiest) to 4 (most
difficult). There are more enemies crawling through the path with increasing
difficulty levels.

The player can be moved with arrow keys.

When the player reaches the water it will score a new goal and go back to the
initial position.

Enjoy!
